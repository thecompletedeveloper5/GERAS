# GERAS

Assumptions: 
------------
Location is approximate
Nearest service provider location does not guarantee the fastest time - as search is done using Lat & Long
There are multiple other factors in the real life like the service tier, urgency level etc which are not considered in this solution. 
Service provider is assumed to be roadside assistant. Other service providers are ignored for this solution. 
Not accounted for concurrency - to simplify the solution
FindNearestAssistant will only get the non-reserved assistants
